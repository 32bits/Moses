{"name":"Moses","tagline":"Utility library for functional programming in Lua","body":"ï»¿[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Yonaba/Moses.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Yonaba/Moses)\r\n\r\nA utility library which provides a set of helpers acting as shortcuts for common programming tasks,\r\nand support for [functional programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). It complements the built-in __Lua table library__, making easier operations on arrays, lists, \r\ncollections, objects, through 85 weird, strange, bizarre, odd functions.<br/>\r\n__Moses__ was deeply inspired by [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/).\r\n\r\n##Download & Installation\r\n###Bash\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone git://github.com/Yonaba/Moses.git\r\n````\r\n\r\n###Archive\r\n* __Zip__: [current](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/archive/master.zip) | [old packages](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/tags)\r\n* __Tar.gz__: [current](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/archive/master.tar.gz) | [old packages](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/tags)\r\n\r\n###LuaRocks\r\n```\r\nluarocks install moses\r\n````\r\n\r\n###MoonRocks\r\n```bash\r\nluarocks install --server=http://rocks.moonscript.org/manifests/Yonaba moses\r\n````\r\n\r\n##Usage##\r\nPut the file [Moses.lua](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/moses.lua) inside your project folder and call it using *require* command.\r\n\r\n__Note__: \r\nThe full source [moses.lua](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/moses.lua) is quite heavy (47 kiB).<br/>\r\nYou can alternatively use the [minified version](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/moses_min.lua) which is lighter (14 kiB).\r\n\r\n##Usage examples##\r\nFind a complete set of samples in [moses.md](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/docs/moses.md)\r\n  \r\n##Documentation##\r\nA fully complete documentation, in HTML-format, can be found in [Docs](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/docs), and is also available for [download](http://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/downloads). <br/>\r\n\r\n##Credits and Acknowledgement##\r\n* [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://github.com/jashkenas), for the amazing [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/)\r\n* [Marcus Irven](http://mirven.github.com/underscore.lua/)'s and [JTArchie](https://github.com/jtarchie/underscore-lua)'s 1-to-1 ports that also inspired this.\r\n* The amazing Lua  source code documentation tool [LDoc](https://github.com/stevedonovan/ldoc/) (from *Steve Donovan*) used to generate he current HTML documentation.\r\n\r\n##Specification\r\nSpecs tests have been included. Run them using [Telescope](https://github.com/norman/telescope) with the following command from the root foolder:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntsc -f specs/*\r\n```\r\n\r\n##License##\r\nThis work is under [MIT-LICENSE](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)<br/>\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Roland Yonaba\r\n\r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\r\n    copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n    \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\n    without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\n    distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\n    permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\n    the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\r\n    in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\r\n    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\n    IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\n    CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\n    TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\n    SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n","google":"UA-33850683-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
